An app designed to help you find restaurants with patios to eat at. Practices basic front end design and back end functionality with some API's tied in. 

Using the Google maps API we can get things like addresses, star ratings, and maps with directions of how to get to any location from where you are. Uses weather api to get information like the temperature and current wind speed to know if it's a good time to be eating outsie on a patio.
